<h2>I: Conditions of Use</h2>

Please read the following Terms and Conditions of Use carefully before accessing or playing Dynasty. If you do not agree with these Terms and Conditions, please stop using the site immediately. By accessing this site and/or playing the game, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. Unless credited otherwise, all materials contained in the site are protected by all applicable copyright and trademark laws.</p>


<p>We reserve the right to change any of these Terms at any time. Such changes come into effect immediately whether we have notified users or not, so please check this page regularly for updates. Although best efforts will be made to notify users of changes to the Terms of Service, we are under no obligations to notify users of any changes made to the Terms or community rules. If you do not follow the Terms in this agreement, or the community rules, you may face disciplinary action including but not limited to temporary or permanent banning of your account and/or your IP address, without notice, warning, or explanation. We also reserve the right to remove/ban any user for any reason not stated in these Terms, without notice, warning, or explanation.</p>


<p>Access to Dynasty is a privilege and Dynasty accounts, dogs, credits (in-game currency), and other items remain the property of Dynasty at all times and are provided as a service to players. We reserve the right to prevent any player’s access to portions of the site, including but not limited to social areas (forums, chatroom), for any reason, without warning or explanation. We also reserve the right to change any portion of the game we find necessary at any point without notification, warning, or explanation to players. We are not obligated to provide any compensation or refunds to players who may be unsatisfied with any changes made to any part of the game, even they have purchased items or upgraded accounts from the Cash Shop, or contributed to the site in any way, including but not limited to adding real breeds to the registry or creating custom breed art.</p>

<h2>II: Privacy Policy</h2>


<p>Your privacy is very important to us. In order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information, please read the Privacy Policy here: <a href="{{ route('privacy') }}">{{ route('privacy') }}</a>. It is your responsibility to read the Privacy Policy before accessing or using the Dynasty site. If you do not agree with the Privacy Policy, you are prohibited from continued use of this site. Again, not having read the Policy does not prevent it from applying to you.</p>


<p>Dynasty is intended for, and only allows registration of players who are 13 years old or older when they register in order to be compliant with COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). If we discover or are made aware that a player is under 13 years of age and circumvented the rule, the player’s account will be banned immediately without warning.</p>


<p>It is your responsibility as a user to keep all of your information private, including but not limited to your identifying details like your real name, age, location, or phone number as well as game-related private details like your password and username. We will not be held liable in the event that a user’s private information becomes known to others in any way for any reason. We are not responsible for any damages resulting from this occurrence or any other action on the part of a player.</p>


<p>By continuing to use the site, you agree that it is your understanding that you have no expectation of privacy while using Dynasty and all communications may be monitored, including private messages, chatrooms, and other social parts of the site. These may be accessed and used as evidence in the event that we need to comply with law enforcement, legal action is required to be taken against a user, or for any other reason, and we are not obligated to give notice, warning, or explanation in taking such actions.</p>


<br />
<hr />
<br />


<h2>III: User-Created Content and Content Sharing</h2>


<p>All users agree by accepting the Terms that they will not upload, distribute or otherwise publish on or in conjunction with, any materials that are considered objectionable, including, but not limited to, libellous, obscene, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, illegal, or otherwise objectionable materials, or materials that would be constituted as a criminal offense, violate the rights of any person, otherwise violate any law, or give rise to any liability.</p>


<p>Any content that is uploaded, posted, or created by user(s) does not reflect the thoughts or opinions of Dynasty or its owners or staff. We reserve the right to delete and/or modify any user-created or user-posted content for any reason without notice, warning, or explanation. Any content that is posted that violates these Terms or the Community Rules may also lead to disciplinary action for user(s) responsible.</p>


<p>Reasons that user-created or user-posted content may be edited or deleted include, but are not limited to, direct violation of copyright law; harassment; racist, homophobic, sexist, threatening, violent, obscene, and/or explicit language used in the content; any form of sexual content, whether express or implied; any illegal material whether direct or referenced; spamming; scamming other users in any way; posting links to sites that disseminate illegal, copyrighted, or otherwise liability-creating content; posting links to innocuous-appearing sites that result in a loud noise and gruesome/scary imagery flashing, which can adversely affect users with epilepsy, heart problems, or various other life circumstances; and content that is damaging to the operation of Dynasty. Dynasty is not responsible for any user-created content anywhere on the site and we are not liable for any damages resulting from actions on the part of users.</p>


<p>Artwork created by user(s) and uploaded for an in-game breed becomes property of Dynasty, and Dynasty may use any such artwork in any way, including but not limited to promotional advertisements on and off the site, as part of game assets in the event the game is sold in part or in its entirety to a third party, and used as the default breed image for the user-created breed. We are not obligated to remove these images from our server at any time for any reason.</p>


<p>With acceptance of these Terms, users agree to not upload, post, or display content that does not belong to them on any part of Dynasty, including but not limited to forums, chatrooms, avatars, kennel descriptions and kennel tab descriptions. Dynasty will not accept any liability for any content posted by users, and reserves the right to remove any such content if it is found on our website. Images taken from search engines also constitute copyright infringement in most cases unless one has express permission from the copyright holder to use the images. It is the responsibility of the user to obtain and be able to prove this permission if required.</p>


<p>Dynasty allows players to create, upload, and use in-game both real-world breeds and breeds created entirely by users through crossbreeding. Any and all such breeds submitted through the Breed Registry become the property of Dynasty and we may remove, update, change, or add to any part of this breed at any time. In the event that Dynasty is sold, in part or in its entirety, all breeds created by users before such an event will be a part of that sale and a part of the game itself. Dynasty is not obligated to remove or change any part or whole of a user-created breed at any point for any reason.</p>


<p>It is strictly forbidden to participate in any illegal activity on Dynasty. Dynasty can and will take legal action if made aware of illegal activities on the site, and will comply fully with any legal and law enforcement authorities participating in an investigation of any action or any result of an action taken by users. Dynasty accepts no liability or responsibility of any form for any actions taken by users on our site.</p>


<br />
<hr />
<br />


<h2>IV: User Safety</h2>


<p>Dynasty is not liable or responsible for any players who show signs of developing an online gaming addiction in part or in whole due to their use of the site. Any player suspecting that they may be suffering from any form of mental illness, including gaming addiction, should seek professional help immediately. All users accept by continuing to use our site that you do so at your own risk and responsibility.</p>


<p>It is prohibited to post on the site, whether in chatrooms, in forums, or elsewhere, content relating to intention to commit suicide or self-harm due to the legal issues surrounding this and we reserve the right to remove any public mention of these topics without warning or notice. Users should immediately seek professional help if they believe they may be suffering from any mental illness. We accept no responsibility or liability for any damages caused by any user action, including improper use of the site.</p>


<br />
<hr />
<br />


<h2>V: Dynasty Staff</h2>


<p>With acceptance of these Terms and use of the site, users agree to listen to and heed the directions and guidance of Dynasty Administrator(s) and/or Moderator(s), known collectively as “Staff” or “Dynasty Staff” or as “Admin” or “Mod(s)”. Any and all violations or suspected violations of these Terms or the Community Rules should be immediately reported to an Administrator or Moderator. Users must not attempt to handle violations of the Terms or the Community Rules themselves, and “mini-modding” is frowned upon and may result in disciplinary action.</p>


<p>Although best effort will be made to do so, Dynasty staff is not obligated to respond to any emails sent <a href="mailto:admin@dynastydog.com">admin@dynastydog.com</a> or any other official Dynasty email account, or any private message sent to a staff member in-game. We reserve the right to ignore any communications for any reason, including but not limited to harassment, rudeness, obscenity, or spamming. Users who break these Terms or the Community Rules in private communication with Staff may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>


<p>If you feel it is necessary to report something you see in forums or chatroom, please voice all concerns to Account #1 Baus, email <a href="mailto:admin@dynastydog.com">admin@dynastydog.com</a>, or use the contact form located on the site’s Contact Staff page.</p>


<p>In the event that another user was disciplined by staff, publicly voicing your concerns in the forums or in the chat room is prohibited. If you feel you or another user was treated unfairly, please contact the account #1 (Baus) directly to discuss any undeserved ill treatment the user may have received. Impersonating any member of Dynasty Staff for any reason, and with any intent, is against the rules and players who do so will be removed from the site without notice, warning, or explanation.</p>


<br />
<hr />
<br />


<h2>VI: Dynasty Accounts</h2>


<p>All Dynasty players may only possess and use one account per individual at any time. Account sharing is prohibited and if made aware of it, we may remove users’ privileges to the account without notice, warning, or explanation. Any players found to be in active possession of more than one account may have their accounts banned permanently at our discretion without notice, warning, or explanation. Dynasty reserves the right to sell, give away, or re-use banned accounts at our discretion.</p>


<br />
<hr />
<br />


<h2>VII: The Cash Shop and Real Money Transactions</h2>


<p>Dynasty is free to play, but certain perks may be purchased at the Cash Shop that may improve the user’s experience of the site or help them with a particular goal. Dynasty has one currency, credits, which may be purchased via the Cash Shop and prices for credit packages are always given in USD. We reserve the right to change prices for any credit package or any other Cash Shop perk at any time without notice. You must be 18 years or older to purchase credits on Dynasty, or else have a parent or legal guardian process the transaction for you.</p>


<p>Dynasty processes all site transactions via Paypal, and as such we do not knowingly collect any information regarding credit cards, debit cards, or other methods of payment from users.</p>


<p>We do not charge any recurring fees or any other hidden fees without the player’s knowledge or approval. If a payment is reversed, credits will be removed from the account in question. If payment is reversed knowingly in at attempt to gain free credits, the player will face a permanent ban and the loss of privileges to use the site. We do not provide refunds for any reason.</p>


<p>Purchasing upgrades, perks or credits in the Cash Shop does not excuse a player from being banned, temporarily or permanently, if they break any of the Terms of Service or Community Rules. If you have paid for credits for your account, but you have not received the credit package you purchased, please message account #1 (Baus) with your Paypal transaction ID.</p>


<p>Any credit transactions made between players on Dynasty, including, but not limited to, selling or trading of accounts and dogs or purchases made in game with Dynasty credits are the sole responsibility of the player(s) involved and engaged in at the player’s own risk. Dynasty Staff is not required to monitor or regulate any transaction on our site. We do not permit reselling Dynasty accounts, dogs, credits, or any other property on the site for real money. Players may sell their own artistic creations for real money on Dynasty forums.</p>


<p>Dynasty allows trade in in-game Dynasty property, including but not limited to credits, accounts, dogs, and breedings, and any services provided by any third-party website or game, provided the other website or game does not prohibit such trades also. It is the responsibility of the players to ensure the third-party website or game allows off-site trade. In the event that trades are being attempted involving a third-party website or game whose Terms of Service prohibits such trades, Dynasty reserves the right to cancel, close, reverse and/or remove any Dynasty property involved in the transaction and temporarily or permanently remove the participating player(s) from Dynasty without notice, warning, or explanation and without any refund for any credits that may have been purchased including any that were being traded.</p>


<p>Dynasty is not responsible, nor liable for anything posted, purchased, or engaged in off of the site itself, or any consequences of such actions on the part of users. Everything is done at the user’s own risk.</p>


<br />
<hr />
<br />


<h2>VIII: Miscellaneous</h2>


<p>We are not responsible for, nor under any obligation to compensate players for any losses or damages incurred while playing Dynasty, whether they be monetary or of any other type of value, and whether they happen due to game glitches, bugs, unforeseen downtime, or related to the behaviour or actions on the part of our players, including permanent or temporary bans from the site, and regardless of whether the issue was within or out of our control.</p>


<p>Players use Dynasty at their own risk. Dynasty will not be held responsible in the unlikely event that Dynasty damages a user in any way, shape, or form, or in the event that Dynasty is exploited by a malicious cyber attack, or for any other reason.</p>


<p>Players must report all bugs and glitches they notice immediately on the Bug Board in the forums. Bugs or glitches that are urgent or serious in nature should be reported via the contact form on the Contact Staff page. Those who are found exploiting a bug may be banned from the game permanently or temporarily and/or have any content obtained through the exploit seized from their account.</p>


<p>If Dynasty staff decides to mediate an issue between players, only content that is visible to us at the time of mediation will be used to decide the best outcome for all parties involved. Screenshots are not a reliable form of proof and will not be considered in the process of mediation during disputes and we are not obligated to look at other forms of proof if we decide they are not reliable either.</p>
